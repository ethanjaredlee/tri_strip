	<p>We're learning about triangle strips and making shapes in EECS 351-Intro to computer graphics right now and I thought it would be convenient to be able to tell if a drawn triangle is backfacing or not.</p>
	<p>Press "space" to hide backfacting triangles and enter to clear.</p>
	<p>Red triangles are backfacing and green are frontfacing</p>
